  "bio": "Swipe right if you\u2019re ready to laugh your way through life! I'm Aryan, a 28-year-old Mumbai explorer, stand-up comedy enthusiast, and aspiring photographer. I\u2019m the type who\u2019ll hit the gym with you at dawn and chase sunsets across the globe by dusk. Empathy is my superpower, and I\u2019m here for both the deep conversations and the spontaneous dance-offs in the living room. Looking for someone who can handle sarcasm as well as they handle sincerity. Let\u2019s create memories that are as vibrant as our city! \ud83c\udf05\ud83d\ude04"
